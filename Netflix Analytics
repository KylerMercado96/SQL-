In this SQL code, I'm querying a database that's holding Nexflix data to answer questions about the data. 

--How many movie titles are there in the database? (movies only, not tv shows?--
SELECT count(*)
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type = 'Movie';

--When was the most recent batch of tv shows and/or movies added to the database?--
SELECT MAX (date(date_added))
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info";

--List all the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order.--
SELECT show_id, type, title
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
ORDER BY title ASC;

--Who was the Director for the movie Bright Star?--
SELECT director, title
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" AS people
    JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" AS titles
    ON people.show_id = titles.show_id 
WHERE title = 'Bright Star';

--What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made?--
SELECT title, release_year
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type = 'Movie'
ORDER BY release_year ASC
LIMIT 1;
