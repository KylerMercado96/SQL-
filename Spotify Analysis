-- For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.--
-- Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.--
-- Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL.-- 
 
Step 1: Creating the table

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

Step 2: I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

Step 3: I explored the data using the following questions and SQL queries. 

--What is the average danceability by artist and track? --

SELECT artist_name, track_name, AVG (danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name 
ORDER BY AVG(danceability) DESC;

--Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity?--

SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

--What artist released the longest song?--

SELECT artist_name, track_name, duration_ms, CAST(duration_ms/60000.0 AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS duration_min 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms DESC; 

--What's the average danceability for the 10 most popular songs?--

SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity, AVG(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

--What is the average popularity for the artists in the Spotify data table. 
For those with a score of 90 or above, they will be labled as a “Top Star”.--

WITH popularity_average_CTE AS (
SELECT spotify.artist_name, AVG(spotify.popularity) AS average_popularity
FROM SpotifyData AS spotify 
GROUP BY spotify.artist_name
)
 
SELECT  artist_name, average_popularity, 'Top Star' AS tag
FROM popularity_average_CTE
WHERE average_popularity>=90;
