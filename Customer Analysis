In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

--How many orders were placed in January?--

SELECT Count(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length (OrderID) >=6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

--How many of those orders were for an iPhone?--

SELECT Count(orderID), product FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length (OrderID) >=6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND Product = 'iPhone';

--Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.--

SELECT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers AS Cust
JOIN BIT_DB. FebSales AS Feb
ON Cust.order_id = Feb.orderID
WHERE length (OrderID) >=6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

--Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?--

SELECT price, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1;

--What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? (Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products).

SELECT SUM (quantity) * price AS revenue, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

--Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?--

SELECT product, location, quantity, SUM(quantity) * price AS revenue
FROM FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101';

--How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?--

SELECT COUNT(distinct cust.acctnum) AS Total_Cus, AVG(quantity*price) AS AVG_spent
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales AS Feb
JOIN BIT_DB.customers AS Cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.--

SELECT product, SUM(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location LIKE "%Los Angeles%"
GROUP BY product;

--Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive?--

SELECT location, COUNT(orderID) AS num_orders
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE location LIKE '%New York%'
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY location
HAVING COUNT(orderID) >= 3;

--How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?--

SELECT sum(Quantity) AS quantity,
Product
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE Product like '%Headphones%'
GROUP BY Product;

--What was the average amount spent per account in February?--

SELECT acctnum, AVG(price) AS AVG_spent
FROM BIT_DB.customers AS cust
JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales AS Feb
ON cust.order_id = Feb.orderID
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY acctnum;

--What was the average amount spent in total for all acounts in February?--

SELECT avg(quantity*price) AS customer_total
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales AS Feb
JOIN BIT_DB.customers AS cust
ON FEB.orderid = cust.order_id
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February?--

SELECT acctnum, AVG(quantity) AS AVG_quantity
FROM BIT_DB.customers AS cust
JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales AS Feb
ON cust.order_id = Feb.orderID
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY acctnum;

--What was the overall average quantity of products purchased by customers in February?--

SELECT sum(quantity)/count(cust.acctnum) AS quantity_total
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales AS Feb
JOIN BIT_DB.customers AS cust
ON FEB.orderid = cust.order_id
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?--

SELECT product, SUM(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY SUM(quantity*price) DESC 
LIMIT 1;
