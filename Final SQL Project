-- In this project I analyzed data from a digital media company named Chinook. This dataset comtains 11 tables. 


-- Show information for all customers not in the USA.--
SELECT *
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country <> 'USA';

--Show only the Customers from Brazil.--
SELECT *
FROM chinook.customers 
WHERE country = 'Brazil';

--Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil.--
SELECT cus.firstname, cus.lastname, inv.invoiceID, inv.billingcountry, inv.total
FROM chinook.customers AS cus
JOIN invoices AS inv ON cus.CustomerID = inv.CustomerID
WHERE country = 'Brazil';

--Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.--
SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Title, ReportsTo, City, State, Country, Phone, Email
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title = 'Sales Support Agent';

--Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.--
SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry, ROUND(SUM(Total), 2) AS Revenue
FROM chinook.invoices
GROUP BY BillingCountry
ORDER BY total DESC;

--Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent.--
SELECT emp.LastName, emp.Firstname, inv.InvoiceId
FROM chinook.Employees emp 
JOIN chinook.Customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;

--Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.--
--The CONCAT function is replaced in SQLite as || ' ' || --
SELECT  
cus.FirstName || ' ' ||cus.LastName AS CusFullName, 
emp.FirstName || ' ' || emp.LastName as SalesRep,
cus.Country,
SUM(total) as Invoice_Total
FROM chinook.invoices AS inv
JOIN chinook.customers AS cus ON inv.CustomerId = cus.CustomerId
JOIN chinook.employees AS emp ON cus.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
GROUP BY CusFullName;
